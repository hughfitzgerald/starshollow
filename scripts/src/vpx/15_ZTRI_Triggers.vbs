' All _Hit subs deleted - GLF generates them for glf_switches members.
' Only the speed-limit helpers survive; call them from an EventPlayer
' binding on s_LeftInlane_active / s_RightInlane_active, or from a
' mode, once you have one.
'
' NOTE: the original had "Sub RighttInlane_Hit" (double t), so the right
' inlane speed limit has never actually run. Both are intact here.
